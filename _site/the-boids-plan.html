<p>Before I decided to register to the “Get Noticed” contest, I had read a whole bunch of posts and articles by attendees of the 2016 edition. They were describing how the participation itself helped them grow as developers, why it is all worth time and effort - and how to prepare yourself to the challenge. Not surprisingly, they all emphasised the significance of having a good, thoughtful plan, factorizing the problem and getting into details of every single step. With that in mind, I started coding with… several sheets of paper and tons of bookmarks open in my browser to analyze what actually needs to be done and how to start. Here is what I have come up with.</p>

<h2 id="stage-1-choosing-tools-and-technologies">Stage 1: Choosing tools and technologies</h2>

<p>This one was quite obvious: HTML &amp; CSS(Sass) for the project’s shell, JavaScript for the engine. Since there are many cool features introduced by ECMAScript 2015 (wider known as ECMAScript 6 or simply ES6), I will try my first steps here, taking advantage of the newly introduced classes, arrow functions, destructuring etc. The Boids themselves will be animated on HTML5 canvas and I plan to prepare an introduction to the canvas API in the nearest future.</p>

<h2 id="stage-2-preparing-the-environment">Stage 2: Preparing the environment</h2>

<p>Another warm-up thing: preparing a visual platform at which Boids will be flying. I have created a palette of swatches (an old designer’s habit) and decided to divide the layout vertically, leaving a left-hand aside for some basic information on the Boids idea and a simple manual. All the rest will be taken up by canvas. Initially I wanted to start with a single bird-oid form animating itself but then I changed my mind and chose a roughly straightforward solution to begin with. The elementary Boids will be simply small circles drawn directly on canvas. Once I figure out all the animation’s algorithms, I will try to think of a way to turn circles into something more complex. First things first.</p>

<h2 id="stage-3-maths">Stage 3: Maths!</h2>

<p>Now here comes the hardest thing for me, or at least at this point it seems so. Getting into counting! Vectors, numbers, algorithms… putting together three seemingly simple rules of flocking put me hardly off. Still, it had to be done. OK, a pile of blank paper sheets and a pen and let’s dismantle the sucker!</p>

<p>I will need a 2D coordinate system and an array of starting positions of Boids (x and y). Thereafter, Boids will be placed on the given coordinates and put into motion. At this point there has to be a function that takes the initial coordinates and counts the next position of each boid as per the rules described in the former post. A quick reminder:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>separation</strong>: steer to avoid crowding</li>
  <li><strong>alignment</strong>: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates</li>
  <li><strong>cohesion</strong>: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s break these apart.</p>

<p>I decided to start with <strong>cohesion</strong>. To calculate it, I will need to find the center of gravity for the flock. This will be the average of coordinates of all the boids except for the one, for which I will calculate the movement. I assume I will move the boid towards the new position by 10% of the newly calculated coordinates, just to keep the whole animation smooth and concise.</p>

<p>Next, I will handle the <strong>separation</strong> rule. This rule needs a constant of the maximum distance between the boids.</p>

<h2 id="stage-4-creating-a-boid-class">Stage 4: Creating a Boid class</h2>

<p>One of the cool new features of ES6 is the introduction of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">classes</a>. Something for you, JS-despisers! JavaScript classes are actually just a bit of syntactic sugar over the Objects and prototypes but they make our code much cleaner and simplify working with inheritance. I will harness this new feature by creating a simple Boid class that keeps the instance’s position and speed (the movement’s vector).</p>

<h2 id="stage-5-initial-animation-for-a-group-of-boids">Stage 5: Initial animation for a group of Boids</h2>

<p>Having the initial group of boids on canvas, I will define the first basic animation. It can be simply running on the X-axis. Once a boid hits the canvas’ border, the direction of the movement will be reverted. Thereafter, I will make boids fly on the Y-axis as well so that they make use of the whole canvas’ area.</p>

<h2 id="stage-6-counting-next-position">Stage 6: Counting next position</h2>

<p>I will need a function that makes use of the previously defined cohesion, separation and alignment rules. This way the function will perform calculations of the next position of a boid, then clear the canvas and redraw it on a new position. At this point I can tell I’d have released the projects’ .beta version. :)</p>

<h2 id="stage-7-changing-the-circle-into-bird-oid-form">Stage 7: Changing the circle into bird-oid form</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to play: circles look dull so I will think of something more creative, probably in a form of bird. It would be great if every single boid would also animate itself, as if it was flying. If I get stuck, I will continue with the next steps and come back here after resolving the rest of the issues.</p>

<h2 id="stage-8-adding-controls">Stage 8: Adding controls</h2>

<p>At this point I can hand over the control to the user, letting them decide on the boids’ amount, speed, distance etc. I will need a way to get data from the user: it can be a set of range sliders, buttons or other types of inputs.</p>

<h2 id="stage-9-first-roadblock">Stage 9: First roadblock</h2>

<p>Time for a first roadblock! I will put a static circle imitating an obstacle and write a function that steers boids away of it. More calculations ahead…</p>

<h2 id="stage-10-dynamic-roadblocks-on-users-click">Stage 10: Dynamic roadblocks on user’s click</h2>

<p>Now that I have a working roadblock, I will put the user in charge of adding and deleting the roadblocks. Guess the simplest option will be by clicking on the canvas to create a roadblock, then another click on the roadblock created would delete it. I may want to change the way the roadblocks look, perhaps add some randomness here too.</p>

<h2 id="stage-11-getting-it-nice">Stage 11: Getting it nice!</h2>

<p>Once all is working fine and tested, I’ll get back to my Sass and add some styling so that the whole thing simply looks good. It’s also time to develop the aside part, put some more information here and maybe think of some kind of introductory part that tells the story behind the project. I hope to get back to this point before the planned 10 weeks pass.</p>

<h2 id="where-am-i-now">Where am I now?</h2>

<p>At this moment things are going quite fine. I got to the Stage 6 and the boids are flying as planned. You can check the current status <a href="https://ka1130.github.io/Boids/src/">here</a>. In case you were curious, all the code goes to a <a href="https://github.com/ka1130/Boids">GitHub repo</a>. Wish me good luck! :)</p>
