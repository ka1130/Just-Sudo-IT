            <h2><a href="/reasons-for-changing-career-path">Why I changed my career path</a></h2>


            <p>OK, time for a coming out. I am 33 years old and I have just started my career as Junior Front-End Developer. My former position? Senior Graphic Designer. I have been working in the design industry for 9 years, after completing 5 years long studies in the Graphic Design faculty. Adding 2 years of pre-study preparations, it gives me 16 years that I have just turned into dust. Sounds gloomy but, believe me, I feel really happy and excited. Many people ask me why I quit a stable, well-paid job, with no after-hours and familiar environment to… work much more for less(which is obvious at the beginning). Why did I then spend a big part of my savings to get into a full-time programming bootcamp that was eating up to 11-12 hours a day? And how come I find it really cool as opposed to designing, which people believe is more play than work? Well, the answer demands a whole story.</p>

            <p>Working on a website project is not only about writing code in HTML, CSS and JS. When it comes to deployment or using preprocessors for instance, you need some tasks to be done repeatedly, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>concatenating and minifying CSS and JavaScript files</li>
  <li>compiling Sass to CSS (I highly recommend writing in Sass rather than pure CSS, especially if you work on a little bit bigger project)</li>
  <li>reloading your browser each time you introduce changes to your styles</li>
  <li>compressing images</li>
  <li>watching Sass for changes</li>
  <li>…and so on :)</li>
</ul>

            <h2><a href="/canvas-introduction">The canvas API</a></h2>


            <p>Two posts ago I promised to tell you something more about the HTML5 technology that I use to draw and animate Boids, that is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. As you have probably guessed, it is basically just an HTML tag - but its possibilities are truly impressive. With the use of a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and JavaScript you can create advanced games, multimedia applications, charting - and much more. This is because canvas is very fast and efficient so it can perform complicated calculations and animations. Since canvas is a pixel-based API, you can go as far as manipulating pixels, creating for instance some impressive filters for your photos. The possibilities are endless!</p>

            <p>If you follow me along on “Just sudo IT”, you remember <a href="http://just-sudo-it.pl/jekyll-on-windows-part1">the post about setting up Jekyll</a>. We have ended up with a basic set-up of a default Minima-themed blog. Great for beginning but now time has come to customize it to your liking. You will probably want to adjust the layout, install a chosen template (you can also style your blog completely from scratch but we’re not going to cover this case here), add custom domain etc. Let’s see how to do it.</p>

            <p>For many years I have been using Wordpress as an obvious choice when choosing a blogging platform. Wordpress is by far the most popular CMS on the market, supported and developed for 14 years, powering around 8% of all pages in World Wide Web. That speaks for itself. However, since I’ve been keeping my projects on GitHub pages for the last few months, I’ve discovered it might be much easier to run the next blogging project directly on GitHub server and make use of Jekyll due to its native support in GitHub pages.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what the heck is this Dsp2017 in the categories’ section and what actually am I doing here, starting yet another programming blog with little experience in front-end development. Well, what got me going with all this stuff is a competition opened by <a href="http://devstyle.pl/o-mnie/">Maciej Aniserowicz</a>, founder of <a href="http://devstyle.pl">Devstyle</a> blog, one of the best of the kind in Poland. “Dsp” is a Polish acronym for “Get Noticed” and this is exactly the name of the competition. It is targeted at literally all programmers, no matter how experienced they are. Anyone can join, work on their own project, blog about it, share their knowledge and learn at the same time.</p>
