Hi, I'm Kamila and I've recently quit my profession to learn coding. Quite a brave decision after 5 years of studies and 9 years of work in one field. However, I gave it a try and found out it was a great choice. Dev's job is very rewarding, exiting and, in contrast to the common belief, truly creative. I'd like to share my passion with you and hope you will find some of the lines here useful. 

Feel welcome to [drop me a line](mailto:ka1130@o2.pl) or leave a comment if you have any questions, encounter a mistake or inaccuracy or wish to share some infos. We are here to learn from one another.
