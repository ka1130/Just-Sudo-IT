OK, time for a coming out. I am 33 years old and I have just started my career as Junior Front-End Developer. My former position? Senior Graphic Designer. I have been working in the design industry for 9 years, after completing 5 years long studies in the Graphic Design faculty. Adding 2 years of pre-study preparations, it gives me 16 years that I have just turned into dust. Sounds gloomy but, believe me, I feel really happy and excited. Many people ask me why I quit a stable, well-paid job, with no after-hours and familiar environment to… work much more for less(which is obvious at the beginning). Why did I then spend a big part of my savings to get into a full-time programming bootcamp that was eating up to 11-12 hours a day? And how come I find it really cool as opposed to designing, which people believe is more play than work? Well, the answer demands a whole story.

## The choices

I was struggling with career choices from a young, actually too young age. The world seemed so inspiring that I wanted to do everything, preferably, everything simultaneously. ;) And yet, everybody around told me I needed to pick up just one thing and concentrate on that since, they explained, I’d have only one profession in my adult life. Trying to figure out what to choose from the growing amount of possibilities, one thing was sure to me: it must be something creative. I ended up going for graphic design - not that I had any special manual skills - but I have always loved arts of any kind and designing seemed really alluring. Plus, since the collapse of Communism in Poland, the advertising industry was thriving. Finishing our studies on 2007, me and almost all my fellow students dreamed of working in a “real” advertising agency, imaging it the coolest and most rewarding job in the world.
