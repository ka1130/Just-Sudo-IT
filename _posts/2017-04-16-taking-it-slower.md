If you follow along the Boids project, you might have notice it slowed down notably in the last time. This is because of various reasons:
+ I have recently started my first job in the profession so you can imagine I feel a bit overwhelmed and try to keep focused on daily tasks as much as I can
+ Planning the posts and writing them takes a massive amount of time, especially as my English is not perfect and I need to research some phrases
+ Last half a year was extremely active for me (changing profession and tons of coding work) and I assume I might be a bit tired, even though I am not happy accepting this fact

That leads me to some afterthoughts on motivation issues, organizational skills and “just-sudo-it” approach.

## The general message

We all hear it, read it and maybe even keep repeating ourselves every day. *Your only limit is you.* *Wake up with determination, go to bed with satisfaction.* *Don't stop when you're tired, stop when you're DONE.* And, yep, *just sudo it* on top of that. Already motivated? Slightly bored and doubtful? Or simply sick of the bullshit behind? If you've reached the last level, I have good news for you: you really don't need to push any harder. Listen to your inner voice. There are times when less is more. And, yes, that applies to your work, projects and goals too.

## The quiet message

Several years ago I was overcoming one of the toughest times in my life. There was a huge self-work that I needed to do, urgently, as I believed. And even though I was extremely motivated, trying to find a fix, trying as hard as I could - I was stuck. And then I met somebody who told me something I wouldn't expect at all: Kamila, your motivation level is too high. I thought I misheard. But I did not. You see, if you drew a chart with motivation level on its X axis and efficiency of your efforts on its Y axis, guess how the line would look like? Would it be a simple ascendant bar? Absolutely not, it would look more like a gaussian curve with its highest point something in between of your motivation's potential. That means that too much motivation is equally crippling as none of it. If you push yourself too much, ignoring your fatigue and emotions, you're bound to fail. There are points where taking a break or slowing things down brings much better results in the end than never ending pressure. Consider that next time you feel overwhelmed and things are just starting to be much too much. Maybe you should overcome the crisis and keep going. Or maybe it's high time to take things really easy. You know the answer if you start listening to yourself more than to the outer world.

## Balancing it all out 

The hardest thing is to balance the two concepts. I was just about to give up this project: there's a huge amount of learning awaiting me in my job (I am lucky enough to be paid for undergoing a programming training now :)), I need to remind myself how to charge my batteries after work, my house asks for some care at last, et cetera, et cetera. However, I am giving the project a chance. There is already an explicit plan for further steps and some corrections of the code and I plan to re-run Boids in the days to come. Your fingers crossed will help! :)
