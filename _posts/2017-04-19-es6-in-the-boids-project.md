The introduction of ECMAScript 2015 standard, also known as ES6, is a quantum leap for JavaScript that the language hadn’t seen since 2009. I didn’t realize the significance of the changes until very recently when I started to learn the new ES6 features. Some of them are pretty self-explanatory, the others took me more time to comprehend - and there’s still a bunch of stuff I have only blurry idea about. Since the best way of learning to code is actually… to code, I decided to introduce ES6 to the Boids project. And you know what, it considerably simplified and clarified the work. So I decided to share some insight with you. Here are the 8 ES6 features I have used when programming Boids.

## 1. Block-Scoped Constructs Let and Const


## 2. Arrow Functions


## 3. Default Parameters


## 4. Template Literals 


## 5. Array Helpers


## 6. Rest & Spread Operators


## 7. Destructuring


## 8. Classes


## Babel


## Summing Up
