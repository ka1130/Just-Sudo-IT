To my great surprise I have discovered lately a huuuge controversy around preparing to a developerâ€™s job in a way other than: a) graduating from a University of Technology; b) self-study. The c) option are coding schools that in the most common case run programming bootcamps preparing freshmen to their first Junior Developer position. I am the one that went for the c) option (which does not exclude self-study, quite the opposite: it forces unassisted work as much as possible). 

My choice was [Coders Lab](http://coderslab.pl/) due to its long-term reputation - and because I kept their handout for 3 years as a fallback plan for my career. Coders Lab offers two paths: Front-End / Back-End, in a pace of your choice: full-time (which takes 6 weeks) / weekend (15 weeks). I enrolled to a full-time Front-End bootcamp that I finished in the end of January 2017.
