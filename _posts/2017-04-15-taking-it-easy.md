If you follow along the Boids project, you might have notice it slowed down notably in the last time. This is because of various reasons:
+ I have recently started my first job in the profession so you can imagine I feel a bit overwhelmed and try to keep focused on daily tasks as much as I can
+ Planning the posts and writing them takes a massive amount of time, especially as my English is not perfect and I need to research some phrases
+ Last half a year was extremely active for me (changing profession and tons of coding work) and I assume I might be a bit tired, even though I am not happy accepting this fact

That leads me to some afterthoughts on motivation issues, organizational skills and “just-sudo-it” approach.
